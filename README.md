How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs in a program is to consider how the end user aims to use the program. User stories are the cases in which the user interacts with the program and we can get an idea of the priorities for the site.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
To approach the development of a program, I would consider the requirements and if a waterfall method approach or agile works best. Considering the end users and scability in mind, it's important for me to be flexible and use whatever benefits my current program.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good communicator and team player is considered a good team member in software development. At the end of the day, we are a team and it is important to try to work together. No matter what we struggle on, the project is not built with one developer in mind but a team of many contributors.
